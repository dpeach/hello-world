# hello-world
My first Git repository. Practice session.

The purpose of this project is to just learn how to use GitHub and Git. Currently working on a Chromebook, but when I get back to a real computer maybe I can use Git too.
The previous comment was on one line. Should I manually break the lines?

Maybe I have to do a double line feed to make a new paragraph.

How's this?
